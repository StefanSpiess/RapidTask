This is the initialization module for the project.

The ``__init__.py`` file marks this directory as a Python package and 
can be used to execute package-level initialization code. Currently, 
this file serves as the entry point for the package and does not 
contain any additional functionality.

.. note::
    Additional modules and functionality will be added to this package 
    in the future. Each module will be documented individually.
