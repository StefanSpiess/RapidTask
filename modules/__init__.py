"""
This is the initialization file for the modules folder of the Python application.

The ``__init__.py`` file is used to mark the directory as a Python package and 
can also be used to initialize the package, define package-level variables, 
or import specific modules to simplify access for users of the package.

Modules in this folder are designed to provide reusable functionality for the 
application. Ensure that each module is well-documented and adheres to the 
application's coding standards.

Attributes:
    __all__ (list): A list of module names to be imported when 
        ``from modules import *`` is used. Modify this list to control 
        the public API of the package.
