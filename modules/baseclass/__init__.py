"""
This module serves as the initialization file for the project and defines the 
`BaseClass`, which acts as the foundational parent class for all other classes 
in the module.

Classes:
    BaseClass: A generic base class providing fundamental methods such as 
    getters and setters. All other classes in this project should inherit 
    from `BaseClass` to ensure consistent behavior and shared functionality.

Note:
    Additional functionality and specific implementations will be added in 
    separate `.py` files within this module.
